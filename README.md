### Basic Usage

After cloning, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp default` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` runs browserSync and watchFiles parallel and opens the project in your default browser then live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have npm installed globally in order to use this build environment.


This is by far my favorite project because I will continue improving it and adding more content as I expand my knowledge.
I used the [Grayscale](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale) theme from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
