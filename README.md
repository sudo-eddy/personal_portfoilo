# [This is my portfolio](https://sudo-eddy.github.io/)

## Welcome to my personal portfolio.

In my website you will find my main projects. Including some vanilla Javascript, some basic Ruby on Rails, as well as some Node content and a couple of simple MERN apps.
I also have a section for my creative works which include some basic designs I made for a few clients. My favorite one is the logo I created for my family business because I created it using AutoCAD and finished it off with Inkscape. I was in my early stages of learning and I was having a hard time tyring to implement the design idea in Photoshop. It could definitely use a redesign, and I'm up for the challenge.

Whatever is not included in my website you may find it in my repos, I have some exercises and other simple projects.



This is by far my favorite project because I will continue improving it and adding more content as I expand my knowledge.
I used the [Grayscale](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-grayscale) theme from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
